## Hosting a House

So you want to host a house and have trick-or-treaters visit you?  It's easy and
you don't even need to buy any candy.  All you need is a computer and Zoom.

### Beforehand

Make sure you have Zoom installed and that it works.  At this point in 2020
everyone knows how to use Zoom, right?  Create a scheduled meeting which is
scheduled to start at 5:00pm PST on October 31.  Then fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/R9fPt49wtiM4AxgV9)
to register your house.  You will need to provide the invite link to your
scheduled meeting in the form.

After you have registered, you will be emailed these instructions as well as
your house's secret code word.

### On Halloween Night

At 5:00 on Halloween night, join the Zoom meeting you scheduled.  Trick-or-treaters
will be visiting this meeting throughout the night.  Just like with in-person
Halloween, you might not get any visitors right away.

You don't need to sit in front of your computer the whole time but make sure:

* Your computer doesn't turn off, go to sleep, or end the meeting
* You disable the waiting room so that trick-or-treaters can join
* You have your volume turned up loud enough that you can hear anyone who arrives
  and says "Trick or Treat!"

### When trick-or-treaters arrive

When trick-or-treaters join your meeting, greet and talk to them!  Feel free to
show them your costume if you have one, ask them about their costume if they
have one, tell them a Halloween joke, sing a Halloween song, or anything you
like.  Aim to have a 2-5 minute interaction with them and then tell him your
house's secret code word (the code word lets them get treats from their
parent/caregiver).  After you tell them the code word, they will say thank you
and then leave the meeting to move on to another house.

That's it!

### Zoom gotchas

Most Zoom meetings can only last for 40 minutes.  When your Zoom meeting runs
out of time, create a new one and use [the form](https://forms.gle/R9fPt49wtiM4AxgV9)
to register the new meeting link.  I'll try to get your house back online as
quickly as possible.

### One more thing...

I hope I don't have to say this but please be welcoming to any trick-or-treaters
regardless of age, whether they have costumes, or anything else.  The whole
point is just to have some judgment-free fun.  Plus, it's not like you're
going to run out of candy.
