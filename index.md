How does trick-or-treating work during a global pandemic?  I'm glad you asked!

Anyone who wants to host a "house" will create a Zoom meeting and will be given
a secret code word.  Kids will visit the "houses" (Zoom meetings) and ask for
that house's code word.  They will exchange code words for treats from their
parent/caregiver.
