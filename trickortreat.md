## Trick-or-Treating

Virtual trick-or-treating is different then in-person trick-or-treating in that
you have to supply the treats yourself and no one leaves the house.  Not ideal,
I know, but it's better than nothing!

Here's how it works:

### Beforehand

Before Halloween night, buy the treats for your kids.  One advantage this has
is that you can control exactly what your kids get.  If you want, you can divide
up the treats into portions ahead of time, or you can do that on Halloween night.

Make sure you have Zoom installed and that it works.

Register as a trick-or-treater using [this form](https://forms.gle/eFu4AjQ6LsfhBkxY9).
After you register you will get an email with these instructions.

### On Halloween Night

On the day of Halloween I will email you a list of code words.  Keep this list
secret from the kids but have it handy during Halloween night.

Any time from 5:00pm-6:30pm PST you can trick-or-treat by visiting [the map](map).
The map is a page with a list of houses.  Clicking on a house will join a Zoom
meeting with whoever is hosting that house.

### Visiting a House

For kids:

When you join the Zoom meeting, loudly announce "Trick or Treat!".  The host
may not be at their computer but if you say "Trick or Treat!" they will hear
you and come over.  Feel free to show off your costume if you have one!  After
talking to the host for a few minutes, they will tell you a secret code word.
After getting the secret code word, say thank you and leave the meeting.  Tell
the secret code word to your parent/caregiver and they will give you a treat!
Then move on to a new house on the map.

For parents/caregivers:

When your kids tell you a secret code word, check it off the list and give them
a portion of the treats.

### FAQ

*What if join a house and no one is here?* 

Make sure to loudly announce "Trick or Treat!" so that the host knows that you're
there.  If no one shows up after a minute or two, leave the meeting and move on
to another house.

*Are costumes required?*

No.  If the idea of getting costume(s) together is more stressful than fun, you
will face absolutely no judgment for coming as you are.

*Do I need to register to participate?*

Not really.  If you register I will send you a list of the code words that the
kids will be collecting.  But even if you don't have the list, you can just
give the kids a portion of treats every time they visit a house.  Or just
(kids: don't read this) pretend to verify the code words on a fake list.

*Can we trick-or-treat as a group?*

Definitely!  Just make sure everyone in your group knows which house you're
going to next so that you all go to the same meeting.
